## Overview
### Motivation 
Have you ever been curious about your friends new shoes, or attracted by fancy shoes shows on ins photos? Time to try Nike shoes Recognizer! Traditional shoe classification systems struggle to differentiate among detailed and similar categories of Nike shoes. This project aims to improve classification precision by utilizing a Vision Transformer (ViT) model known for its effectiveness in handling complex image data.

In the past, the main approach to solve these tasks is Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). However, CNNs usually struggling when using on shoes recognization since shoes from the same brand usually have similar shape structure. And CNN perform weakly in extracting effective features for differentiation. Thus it is usually not precise enough to classify shoes.
